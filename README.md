## Implementation and Optimization of Pairs Trading Strategy

With the continuous opening of China's financial market and the development of the Internet and big data, quantitative trading has gradually emerged in China's market and become an indispensable part of the financial market. With the popularization of quantitative trading, investors' demand for quantitative development is increasing, and the realization of various quantitative strategies is accelerating.

The goal of this paper is to develop the transaction strategy expansion package based on Python platform, taking the matched transaction strategy based on the cointegration model as an example. Due to the large amount of data in stock selection, this paper focuses on the realization of the system and the optimization of the system, including the improvement of the performance of the system from the perspective of algorithm, programming language and parallel, so as to improve the speed of stock selection in pairing trade and realize the function of backtesting. The algorithm is based on the theoretical analysis, the programming language angle uses C + + to replace Python functions, the mixed programming mode, and the parallel angle mainly uses the thread call of C + + to optimize the program.

In this paper, the theory of matching transaction, the implementation of strategy and the construction and optimization of the system are sorted out in detail. It is believed that it can provide support for quantitative investors, and can also contribute some reference and help to the developers based on Python quantitative strategy package.

Key words: quantitative transactions, pairs trading, matching algorithm, parallel optimization, hybrid programming
